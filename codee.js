Dear----------,

Welcome to the Western Union TEC (Technology Engineering Center) Hyderabad. 

TEC premises are secured, and access is restricted. We would like to provide you with information on the security protocols you must adhere to throughout your time with us. 

•	Your photo ID card must be always displayed on site while you are at the Western Union premises.
•	During entry and exit from the premises, make sure to flash your access card at the card reader.
•	Do not lend your access card to anyone. Avoid borrowing someone else's ID Card.
•	Do not engage in tailgating or proxy punching.
•	Approval from the Process Owner is required to grant or revoke access to certain restricted work areas. You need to create a separate iPads ticket for the same.
•	Please acknowledge and respond to any email sent from the Global Security Operation Center (GSOC) regarding any access violation.
•	Failure to close a door on the premises will cause the door delay alarm to be triggered in the access control system. 
•	It is important to close the door behind you when entering or exiting.
•	Your visitors are required to register at the reception during their entry. Make sure your visitors are escorted and accompanied throughout their visit. 
•	Be alert and aware. If you encounter any strange, suspicious, or unusual behavior or event, report it to the on-site security.
•	Report the loss of the card immediately to the Global Security Operation Center (GSOC). 
•	The office is open between 8am and 8pm every day. 
•	In case a female colleague needs to work late after 8 PM, it is important to obtain approval from both your manager and local HR.  After approval, inform the Site Operations Team and Security 
and book your transport ahead of time.

At the end of the day:

•	Tidy your desk.
•	Make sure any sensitive material is secured.
•	Secure drawers, file cabinets, and other items.
•	Make sure that expensive equipment such as laptops and other devices are secured.
•	Ensure that your personal belongings are secure. For example, mobile phones, chargers, and wallets.
•	Keeping them under lock and key or in a secure location when you're not on your workstation is crucial.
•	Should there be any problems with access, kindly send an email to GSOC-GlobalSecurityOperationCenter.SharedMailbox@westernunion.com.
